# Examples Directory

This directory contains complete example projects that demonstrate how to use the AI-Optimized Project Template to generate production-ready applications.

## Available Examples

### 1. Task Manager API (Node.js + React)
**Location**: `task-manager-demo/`

A complete, production-ready task management application showcasing:
- RESTful API backend with Node.js/Express
- React frontend with modern UI
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Comprehensive documentation
- Tests and quality checks

**What It Demonstrates**:
- How AI agents interpret PROJECT_BRIEF.md
- Complete code generation workflow
- Documentation generation
- Infrastructure setup
- Testing strategy
- Deployment configuration

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd task-manager-demo/
cat PROJECT_BRIEF.md  # Review the requirements
cat GUIDE.md          # Follow the step-by-step guide
```

## How These Examples Work

Each example demonstrates the complete AI-driven project generation workflow:

1. **Start with PROJECT_BRIEF.md** - A filled-out requirements document
2. **AI Reads Requirements** - Shows how AI agents interpret the brief
3. **Generated Code** - Complete application code created by AI
4. **Documentation** - All necessary docs auto-generated
5. **Infrastructure** - Deployment configs and CI/CD pipelines
6. **Testing** - Complete test suite

## Using These Examples

### As a Learning Tool
1. Read the `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` in each example
2. Review the `GUIDE.md` for step-by-step explanation
3. Examine the generated code structure
4. See how documentation is organized
5. Understand the AI agent's decision-making process

### As a Template
1. Copy an example that matches your needs
2. Modify the `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` to your requirements
3. Use an AI assistant to regenerate based on your changes
4. Customize the generated code as needed

### As a Reference
- Study the code patterns and architecture
- Learn best practices for project structure
- Understand documentation organization
- See how AI agents structure applications
