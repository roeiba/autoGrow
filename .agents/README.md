# AI Agent Guidelines & Maintenance

> **This folder contains guidelines for AI agents and repository maintenance documentation**

## For AI Agents

If you're an AI agent working on a project generated from this template:

**Start here:** Read [project-rules.md](project-rules.md) - This is your master guideline document.

## For Repository Maintainers

If you're maintaining the template repository itself:

- **[MAINTENANCE.md](MAINTENANCE.md)** - Repository maintenance guide
- **[CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE.md](CONTRIBUTING_GUIDE.md)** - Detailed contribution process
- **[project-rules.md](project-rules.md)** - Master AI agent guidelines

## Other Files

The following files are planning/launch documents (can be archived or removed after launch):
- `github-optimization.md`
- `launch-checklist.md`
- `reddit-launch-plan.md`
- `social-media-launch.md`

## Purpose

This folder keeps all agent-related and maintenance documentation separate from user-facing documentation, making the repository cleaner and easier to navigate for end users.
