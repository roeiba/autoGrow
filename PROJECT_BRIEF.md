## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project Name**: AI-Optimized Project Template

**Brief Description**: 
A comprehensive project template system that enables AI agents to generate complete, production-ready software projects from a single requirements document. The template provides structured guidelines, enterprise architecture patterns, and comprehensive documentation frameworks that AI assistants can follow to build professional applications.

**Problem Statement**:
Software project setup is time-consuming and error-prone, requiring developers to repeatedly create boilerplate code, documentation structures, CI/CD pipelines, and architectural decisions. AI coding assistants lack structured guidance to generate consistent, high-quality project foundations. Teams waste weeks setting up projects instead of building features.

**Target Users**:
Software development teams, AI coding assistants, project managers, startup founders, and enterprise development teams who need to rapidly bootstrap new projects with professional standards and comprehensive documentation.

## 🔄 Key User Flows

### Flow 1: Initial Project Setup
1. Human clones ai-project-template repository
2. Human fills out PROJECT_BRIEF.md with project requirements
3. Human provides brief to AI agent with generation prompt
4. AI agent reads PROJECT_BRIEF.md and .agents/project-rules.md
5. AI agent creates session log and generates complete project structure
6. Human reviews generated code and approves for development

### Flow 2: Ongoing Development
1. Developer/AI selects task from tasks/active/ directory
2. Agent reads relevant .agents/ guidelines for the component
3. Agent implements feature following established patterns
4. Agent writes tests and updates documentation
5. Agent updates task status and moves to completed
6. Code is reviewed and merged into main branch

## 📝 Additional Context

This template represents a paradigm shift in software development where AI agents become first-class participants in the development process. The template is designed to be:

**Self-Documenting**: Every decision and pattern is documented for future AI agents to understand and follow.

**Evolutionary**: The template improves through use - each project generated provides feedback to enhance the guidelines.

**Community-Driven**: While maintaining consistency, the template should evolve with community contributions and new best practices.

**Production-Ready**: Generated projects should be immediately deployable with professional standards, not just prototypes.

The success metric is simple: Can an AI agent, given only a filled PROJECT_BRIEF.md, generate a complete, production-ready project that a human developer would be proud to deploy?
