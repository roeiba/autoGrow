# TaskFlow Requirements & Business Context

> **Generated by AI from PROJECT_BRIEF.md**
> This document captures business requirements and domain knowledge

## Business Context

### Market Need

Teams are struggling with fragmented task management solutions. Current tools either:
- **Too Complex**: Enterprise solutions (Jira) with steep learning curves
- **Too Simple**: Basic tools lacking collaboration features
- **Not Real-Time**: Delayed updates requiring manual refreshes
- **Poor Integration**: Weak connections to development workflows

TaskFlow addresses this gap by providing a **balanced solution** that's:
- Easy to learn and use
- Powerful for growing teams
- Real-time by default
- Deeply integrated with developer tools

### Target Market Segments

1. **Software Development Teams (Primary)**
   - Size: 5-50 developers
   - Need: Integration with GitHub, real-time collaboration
   - Pain: Context switching between tools
   - Value: Unified workflow from task to deployment

2. **Project Managers (Secondary)**
   - Need: Visibility into project progress
   - Pain: Outdated information, manual status updates
   - Value: Real-time dashboards and automatic updates

3. **Remote/Distributed Teams (Secondary)**
   - Need: Asynchronous collaboration
   - Pain: Timezone coordination, communication gaps
   - Value: Activity feeds, notifications, clear task status

### Competitive Landscape

| Solution | Strengths | Weaknesses | TaskFlow Advantage |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Jira | Powerful, customizable | Complex, slow, expensive | Simpler, faster, better UX |
| Asana | User-friendly | Limited dev integrations | Deep GitHub integration |
| Trello | Visual, simple | Lacks structure for large teams | Real-time + structure |
| Linear | Fast, modern | Expensive, no self-host | Open API, competitive pricing |
