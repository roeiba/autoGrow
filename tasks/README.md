# Task Management

> **AI agents will generate tasks here based on `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`**

## What Gets Generated

- **`active/`** - Current work items
- **`backlog/`** - Future features
- **`completed/`** - Finished tasks
- **`templates/`** - Task templates

## How It Works

1. AI reads your `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
2. AI breaks down work into tasks
3. AI creates prioritized task files
4. You track progress as work completes

**For AI agents:** See [../.agents/project-rules.md](../.agents/project-rules.md) for task management guidelines.
