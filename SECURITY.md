   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Security patches released as soon as possible

### Responsible Disclosure

- Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it
- We'll work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Considerations

### Template Security
- Templates generate code that should follow security best practices
- Generated projects include security configurations
- Regular security audits of template patterns

### Generated Project Security
- All generated projects include security headers and configurations
- Dependencies are kept up to date
- Security scanning is included in CI/CD pipelines

### AI Agent Security
- Guidelines include security considerations for AI-generated code
- Session logs help audit AI decision-making
- Clear separation between template logic and generated code
